<H1>Work Day Scheduler</H1>


<H2>Description</H2>
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and as the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Users can click into a time block to enter an event, and upon clicking the save button for that time block, the event text is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
